		<h1>I have good news to share with you!</h1>

		<p>Starting January 1st, 2024, my company will merge with fellow Enrolled Agent Bob Duffield from stiverstax.com. As a result, my practice will move to his office. For you, this change simply means a new location. I'll have a private office to continue serving my clients, and administrative support will also be available.</p>

		<p>At the new firm, I'll join two seasoned Enrolled Agents, a potential new Enrolled Agent, another preparer, and an administrator. I'll be the fourth Enrolled Agent on staff.</p>

		<p>The previous company providing my document portal has been absorbed, and I'll transition to using Stivers' portal. The industry is strongly advocating for portal use over emails, as recommended by insurance companies and the IRS. If you contact the office number provided, one of the assistants can help you set up and use the portal.</p>

		<p>Although the office has a smaller mail slot compared to my current one, both mail and face-to-face appointments are still welcomed. I'll strive to maintain our current level of service. My existing phone number and fax will be ported over temporarily, and my current email remains unchanged.</p>

		<p>I look forward to staying in touch and wish you a wonderful holiday season!</p>
